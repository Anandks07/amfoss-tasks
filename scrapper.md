##GOOGLE SCRAPING USING RUBY


I arrived at the code with the help of these two along with the material given in the task document.
Before coding, I had to install the required gems like nokogiri and pry.
(gem install nokogiri)

first did using pry where my output instead of having only the top 10 searches, has the source code displayed along with the searches in 
the format,
[Nokogiri:HTML:"line1"][Nokogiri:HTML:"line2"].......

Later, I did with css.
