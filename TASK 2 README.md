For task 2, which is the programming part I used C++.

CONCEPTS
Various concepts in C++ have been used to complete the tasks, like arrays, strings and conditionals.
Certain logical concepts had to be worked out for approaching various problems..

Also, I have uploaded a couple of programs which are not entirely correct,i.e they work for some test cases while not for a few others.
