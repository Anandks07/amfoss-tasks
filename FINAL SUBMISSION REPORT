amFOSS FRESHERS TASKS

PLEASE NOTE: The explanation of how I approached the tasks can be found in the github repository. For all the tasks done before the
deadline you can find the explanation directly at the amfoss task repository, while for the tasks done after the deadline you may find them
in the respective task folders.

TASKS DONE BEFORE INITIAL DEADLINE.

TASKS DONE AFTER INITIAL DEADLINE

•	Task 0- Installing ubuntu
•	Task 9- Setting up a simple website(Anandks07.github.io)
•	Task 3 - scrapping. (there seems to be a small problem as instead of the top 10 searches, the source code is being scrapped)
•	Task 15- completed two levels of bandit. 
•	Task 8 - Did captcha breaking and have updated whatever I have done in the repository.
•	Made a blog.
• Participated in the amFOSS code sprint
•	Along with this I tried learning GO and Rust for the respective challenges.

BLOCKERS

•	In google scrapping with ruby, instead of getting only the top 10 searches , I also get the entire source code. The exact error with 
  explanation is mentioned in the summary folder within the task-3 file
•	For certain programs written especially in the Euler tasks, my submissions were not accepted due to time complexity issues. Such 
  submissions have been submitted in my repository and the issue have been duly mentioned as comment in the codes of such programs. 
•	I have just made the website and hosted it with Github. The site does not have any content other than my name and a tagline,but I did
  make a website.
