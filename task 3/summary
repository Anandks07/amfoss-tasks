GOOGLE SCRAPING USING RUBY

This was done with the help of a blog of dev.to/developer community and a youtube video(forgot the link)
I arrived at the code with the help of these two along with the material given in the task document.
Before coding, I had to install the required gems like nokogiri and pry.

BLOCKER:
My output instead of having only the top 10 searches, has the source code displayed along with the searches in the format,
[Nokogiri:HTML:"line1"][Nokogiri:HTML:"line2"].......
I installed ubuntu only on 18/08/19. Have to check whether it works in ubuntu
