INTROSPECTION

 WHY ME?
 
 
•	Eager to learn and to get things done.

•	Have a Computer Science background.

WEAKNESS


•	Feels demotivated when getting error after lot of work.

•	Not able to learn a lot of languages in a month.

HOW WERE YOU BEFORE AND AFTER JOINING?

 BEFORE:
 
 
•	Had only basic knowledge in C++.

•	Very basic knowledge of C.

•	Only text book or school level knowledge.

AFTER:


•	Got familiar with competitive programming sites.

•	Got to know about various terms, software and languages.

•	Started learning python to complete tasks(but still under process).

•	Started to learn and think beyond the scope of textbooks on my own.

•	Got familiar with ruby and Go on a very marginal level

ABOUT THE SELECTION PROCESS.


•	The selection process was well organized and monitored.

•	Frequent reminders by admin helped in increasing net productivity

•	It is not so possible to get familiar with many languages and software in a month. It would be good if all the tasks are in one or 
  two languages, so that we can attempt more number of tasks on subjects in which we have an idea thereby increasing time for doing       tasks and reducing the bigger learning time.
  
PLAN FOR NEXT 6  MONTHS


•	If selected, will indulge in club activities.

•	If not, will prepare myself for the Sem 2 selection activities.

•	Technically, idk.. depends on what happens

CONTRIBUTING BACK


•	Will be regular in club related activities.

•	Work for personal as well as club’s development.

•	Chances offered will be taken for everyone’s benefits.
